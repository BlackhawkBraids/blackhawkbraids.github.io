**Analysis Date:** February 2026

---

## Current Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Current Price | $34.99 |
| 30-Day Sales | 82 units |
| Monthly Revenue (product) | $2,869.18 |
| Conversion Rate | 3.8% |
| Monthly Traffic | 2,100 visits |
| Average Order Value (AOV) | $46.20 |
| Implied Orders | ~80 orders |
| Revenue per Visit | $1.75 |

> **Note:** AOV of $46.20 vs. product price of $34.99 indicates customers frequently add complementary items, contributing an average of **$11.21 in additional revenue per order**.

## Baseline Calculations

```
Monthly product revenue  = 82 units × $34.99          = $2,869.18
Monthly order revenue    = ~80 orders × $46.20         = $3,696.00
Implied orders           = 2,100 visits × 3.8%         = 79.8 ≈ 80
Revenue per visit        = $3,696.00 / 2,100 visits    = $1.76
```

## Price Elasticity Modeling

For handcrafted fashion accessories, price elasticity of demand (PED) typically ranges from **−1.5 to −2.5** (moderately to highly elastic). The scenarios below use **PED = −2.0** as a baseline estimate, meaning a 10% price change produces a ~20% inverse change in unit volume.

### Formula

```
New Units = Current Units × (1 + PED × % Price Change)
New Revenue = New Units × New Price
```

### Scenario Table

| Scenario | Price | % Change | Est. Units | Product Revenue | AOV Revenue | Revenue Δ vs. Current |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Price Cut (−15%) | $29.74 | −15% | 107 | $3,182.18 | $4,943.40 | +$1,247.40 |
| Price Cut (−10%) | $31.49 | −10% | 98 | $3,086.02 | $4,527.60 | +$831.60 |
| Price Cut (−5%) | $33.24 | −5% | 90 | $2,991.60 | $4,158.00 | +$462.00 |
| **Current** | **$34.99** | **—** | **82** | **$2,869.18** | **$3,696.00** | **—** |
| Price Increase (+5%) | $36.74 | +5% | 74 | $2,718.76 | $3,418.80 | −$277.20 |
| Price Increase (+10%) | $38.49 | +10% | 66 | $2,540.34 | $3,049.20 | −$646.80 |
| Price Increase (+15%) | $40.24 | +15% | 57 | $2,293.68 | $2,633.40 | −$1,062.60 |
| Premium Tier (+20%) | $41.99 | +20% | 49 | $2,057.51 | $2,263.80 | −$1,432.20 |

> AOV Revenue = Est. Units × $46.20 (assumes AOV holds across price scenarios)

## Revenue Optimization Analysis

### Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) Sensitivity

| PED Assumption | Optimal Price Range | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| −1.0 (inelastic) | $38–$41 | Customers are less sensitive; higher margins outweigh volume loss |
| −1.5 (moderate) | $36–$38 | Slight price increase still net positive |
| **−2.0 (baseline)** | **$34–$36** | **Near-current price is close to optimal** |
| −2.5 (elastic) | $32–$35 | Volume gains from modest discounts offset margin loss |

### Conversion Rate Impact

A 3.8% conversion rate is **above average** for e-commerce (industry avg: 2–3%), suggesting:
- Strong product-market fit at the current price
- High buyer intent from existing traffic
- Limited headroom to raise prices without conversion decline

---

## Key Findings

1. **Current pricing is near-optimal** under moderate elasticity assumptions (PED ≈ −2.0). Large price increases risk disproportionate volume losses.

2. **AOV lift opportunity:** The $11.21 gap between AOV and product price indicates bundling and cross-sell strategies (e.g., "Complete the Look" sets) can increase total revenue without touching the product price.

3. **Modest price cut (−5% → $33.24)** could increase monthly orders by ~8–10 units and grow AOV revenue by ~$460/month if elasticity holds at −2.0.

4. **Traffic is the primary lever.** At a stable 3.8% conversion rate, each additional 100 visits generates ~3.8 orders × $46.20 ≈ **$175 in incremental monthly revenue**. Growing traffic from 2,100 to 3,000 would yield ~+$34,000 in annualized revenue at current metrics.

5. **Premium pricing test ($38–$40):** If brand positioning supports it, a small-batch A/B test at $37.99 could determine whether the King Cobra commands premium pricing with minimal conversion impact.

## Recommendations

| Priority | Action | Expected Impact |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 High | Run A/B price test at $32.99 vs. $34.99 vs. $37.99 (2-week windows) | Establish empirical PED for this product |
| 🟠 Medium | Introduce a bundle (e.g., King Cobra + matching anklet) at $59.99 | Increase AOV by $5–$15 per order |
| 🟡 Medium | Add urgency/scarcity messaging (e.g., "Only 12 left") | Improve conversion rate toward 4.5–5% |
| 🟢 Low | Invest in SEO/paid traffic to grow visits 20–30% | Revenue growth without margin compression |
| 🟢 Low | Re-evaluate pricing at $36.99 after 60 days of data | Test mild premium positioning |

## Assumptions & Limitations

- Price elasticity estimate (PED = −2.0) is based on industry benchmarks for handcrafted fashion accessories; **actual elasticity should be validated through A/B testing**.
- AOV is assumed to remain constant across price scenarios. In practice, higher product prices may slightly reduce add-on purchases.
- Traffic volume is assumed constant. Paid advertising or seasonal shifts will alter the analysis.
- Analysis covers a single 30-day snapshot; results may vary with seasonality.

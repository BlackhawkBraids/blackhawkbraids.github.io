| Product | Stock | 30-Day Sales | Daily Velocity | Days to Depletion | Risk Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| King Cobra Bracelet | 45 | 78 | 2.60 / day | ~17 days | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Neon Blue Paracord | 120 | 52 | 1.73 / day | ~69 days | 🟢 LOW |

## High-Risk Items

### 🔴 King Cobra Bracelet — CRITICAL

- **Current Stock:** 45 units  
- **30-Day Demand:** 78 units  
- **Daily Velocity:** 2.60 units/day  
- **Estimated Days Until Stockout:** ~17 days  
- **Demand vs. Stock Gap:** −33 units over last period (current stock covers only 58% of recent 30-day demand)

**Risk Drivers:**
- Sales velocity significantly exceeds current on-hand quantity
- At current rate, stock is exhausted well within 30 days
- No buffer exists for demand spikes or limited-drop events

---

### 🔴 Steel Shackle Hardware — CRITICAL

- **Current Stock:** 30 units  
- **30-Day Demand:** 48 selections  
- **Daily Velocity:** 1.60 units/day  
- **Estimated Days Until Stockout:** ~19 days  
- **Demand vs. Stock Gap:** −18 units over last period (current stock covers only 63% of recent 30-day demand)

**Risk Drivers:**
- Shackle hardware is a required component for all King Cobra + steel configurations
- Low absolute stock with high selection frequency compounds risk
- Stockout directly blocks King Cobra Bracelet fulfillment

---

### 🟢 Neon Blue Paracord — LOW

- **Current Stock:** 120 units  
- **30-Day Demand:** 52 builds  
- **Daily Velocity:** 1.73 units/day  
- **Estimated Days Until Stockout:** ~69 days  
- **Status:** Adequately stocked; no immediate reorder required

## Recommended Reorders

| Product | Recommended Reorder Qty | Priority | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| King Cobra Bracelet | 120 units | 🔴 Immediate | Cover 30-day demand (78) + 20% safety buffer (16) + restore baseline (26) |
| Steel Shackle Hardware | 80 units | 🔴 Immediate | Cover 30-day demand (48) + 20% buffer (10) + restore baseline (22) |
| Neon Blue Paracord | — | 🟢 Monitor | Reorder when stock drops below 60 units (~35-day horizon) |

## Forecast Table (Next 30 Days)

| Product | Projected Demand | Projected End Stock | Projected Stockout? |
|---|---|---|---|
| King Cobra Bracelet | ~78 units | −33 units (deficit) | ✅ Yes — Day ~17 |
| Steel Shackle Hardware | ~48 units | −18 units (deficit) | ✅ Yes — Day ~19 |
| Neon Blue Paracord | ~52 units | ~68 units remaining | ❌ No |

## Custom Material Allocation Plan

To protect custom build fulfillment:

- **King Cobra Bracelet:** Reserve 20% of incoming restock (≥24 units) for custom builds before releasing to standard catalog
- **Steel Shackle Hardware:** Reserve 25% of incoming restock (≥20 units) for custom-configured orders — shackle demand correlates directly with premium King Cobra configurations
- **Neon Blue Paracord:** Current stock is sufficient; allocate 30% (~36 units) as reserved custom-build inventory

---

## Slow Inventory Strategy

No slow-moving inventory identified in this analysis period. All three products show positive demand velocity.

# Blackhawk Braids - Frequently Asked Questions

## Product Questions

### Is this real 550 paracord?

**Yes. Absolutely.**

Every Blackhawk Braids product is crafted using **authentic 550 paracord** that meets military specifications (MIL-C-5040 Type III).

**What makes it authentic 550 paracord?**
- **7 inner strands**, each with 3 yarns twisted together
- **Minimum 550 lb tensile strength** (hence the "550" designation)
- **Nylon construction** for durability and weather resistance
- **Meets or exceeds military specifications**

**Why it matters:**
- Genuine 550 paracord is incredibly durable and long-lasting
- Inferior imitations may look similar but lack the strength and quality
- Our paracord is built for tactical use, not just aesthetics

**Our commitment:**
We only source **genuine 550 paracord** from trusted U.S. suppliers. Every piece is inspected for quality before crafting begins.
